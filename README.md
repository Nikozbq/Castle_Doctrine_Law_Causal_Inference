The Impact of Castle Doctrine Laws on Homicide Rates: A Causal Analysis

Description:
This repository contains the code, data, and analysis for our capstone project, which examines the causal impact of Castle Doctrine Laws (CDL) on homicide rates in the United States. Using a combination of advanced causal inference techniques, we assess whether the implementation of CDL has led to an increase in homicides.

Key Highlights:

🔹 Empirical Motivation: CDL grants individuals the right to use force in self-defense without a duty to retreat. However, existing research suggests it may escalate violence rather than deter crime.

🔹 Methodologies Used:

  Synthetic Difference-in-Differences (Synthetic DiD)
    
  Meta Learners (S-Learner & T-Learner)
    
  Causal Random Forest (CRF)
    
  Instrumental Variables (IV) Approach
    
  Traditional Two-Way Fixed Effects (FE) DiD Models

🔹 Key Findings: CDL implementation is associated with a significant increase in homicide rates across different models, raising concerns about its effectiveness in crime deterrence.

🔹 Heterogeneous Treatment Effects: The impact of CDL varies by demographic and socioeconomic factors, with notable disparities in racial and income-based subgroups.
